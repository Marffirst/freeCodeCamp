					Commonly known as the Terminator, the character is also given 
					more specific designations, which help distinguish it from other
					mass-produced Terminators seen in each of the sequels. The end 
					credits of the first three Terminator films list Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
					characters as simply "Terminator", while in Terminator Genisys, he is 
					credited as "Guardian". In Terminator Salvation, the character is credited 
					and referred to as "T-800", while in Terminator: Dark Fate, the character is 
					credited as "T-800 / Carl".

				<p>
					Bottin was tasked with designing the RoboCop costume. He researched the Star 
					Wars character C-3PO, looking at its stiff costume, which made movement difficult. 
					Bottin was also influenced by robot designs in Metropolis (1927) and The Day the 
					Earth Stood Still (1951), and comic book superheros. He developed around 50 
					different designs based on feedback from Verhoeven, who pushed for a more 
					machine-like character. Verhoeven admitted he had unrealistic expectations 
					after reading Japanese science fiction mangas; and it took him too long to 
					realize it, which contributed to the costumes delay. </p>
				<p>
					The RoboCop costume was unprecedented, and both design and construction 
					exceeded cost and schedule. It took six months to build, using 
					flexible foam latex, semi- or completely rigid Polyurethane, and a fiberglass 
					helmet. Moving sections were joined together with aluminum and ball 
					bearings. The entirety of the costume is supported by an internal harness of 
					hooks, allowing for sustained movement during action-heavy scenes. Seven costumes
					 were made, including a fireproof version and costumes to convey sustained damage. 
					 They weighed 25 to 80 lb (11 to 36 kg); reports vary. RoboCop's gun, t
					 he Auto-9, is a Beretta 93R with an extended barrel and larger grip. It was modified 
					 to fire blank bullets, and vents were cut into the side to allow for multi-directional 
					 muzzle flashes with every three-shot burst.
				</p>
				<p>The police cars are 1986 Ford Taurus models painted black. The vehicle featured a 
					customized interior that would show graphical displays for mug shots, fingerprints, 
					and other related information; but the concept was too ambitious. The 6000 
					SUX is an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme modified by Gene Winfield based on a design by 
					Chip Foose. Two working cars were made, plus a third, non-functional one that was 
					used when the vehicle was shown to explode. The 6000 SUX commercial features a 
					plasticine dinosaur animated by Don Waller and blocked by Steve Chiodo.</p>
